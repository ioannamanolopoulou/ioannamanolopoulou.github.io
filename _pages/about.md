Profile
======
I am a Professor of Statistical Science at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/) at [University College of London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), as well as Associate Director of the [HDRUK-Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme/).  I also affiliated to the recently-established [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ucl-ellis.github.io).


I moved to UCL in 2012 after spending 4 years at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and the former [Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI)](https://www.samsi.info/) as a postdoctoral fellow. I was also previously a Turing Fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). 
I moved to Durham NC from Cambridge UK, where I did my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. S. Tavar√©](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/faculty/simon-tavar%C3%A9) and [Prof. S.P. Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Brooks_(statistician)). My PhD thesis was on phylogeographic methods, with title [A Bayesian approach to Nested Clade Analysis](thesis.pdf). You can find a [CV here](files/IoannaManolopoulouCV.pdf).


My main research interests lie in developing, extending or re-evaluating Bayesian models with a view to producing inferences which are useful and interpretable in practical applications. My focus is in flexible modelling tools such as mixture models and tree models and applications of interest range from health data science to retail analytics.
